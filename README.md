**Loan Prediction using Random Forest**

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or not. It uses the Random Forest classification algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method known for its accuracy and robustness. The model is trained on historical loan data, considering features such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, employment status, and property area.Random Forest combines multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. It handles both categorical and numerical data effectively and provides feature importance scores, helping to identify the key factors influencing loan approval decisions.The final model helps financial institutions automate the loan approval process with high accuracy and fairness, reducing manual effort and decision bias.
